# Choose-Your-Own-FInal-Project
Final project for Harvardx Data Science Certificate Program.
We had to choose a dataset and do some analysis on it, I choose https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielkyrka/bmw-pricing-challenge dataset and tried KNN and predTrees
  to see if the models could predict the price of the car accurately, they both did well.
Kind of misunderstood the report instructions and thought I couldn't add models and only had to use words, if actually reporting I would have added graphics like
  in the other final project( IBM repository)
